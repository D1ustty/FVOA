Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity (FVOA)
this program calculates the FVOA using user input values



!Formula:
FV = P * [((1 + r)^nt - 1) / r]
|  'FV' = Future Value.
|  'P' = Payment amount per period. (monthly payment)
|  'r' = Interest rate per period (annual rate / number of periods per years)
|  'n' = Number of periods per year.
|  't' = Number of years.

!Example:
If you pay 500 USD every month for 5 years, and the annual interest rate is 6%:
|  'P' =  500
|  'r' = 0.006 / 12 = 0.005
|  'n' = 12
|  't' = 5
|  'FV' = 34,884 USD
