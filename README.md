<h1> Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity (FVOA) </h1>
<h3> this program calculates the FVOA using user input values </h3>
<h6>!this is a small practice project created while learning the basics of C++</h6>

<h3>!Formula:</h3>
<b>FV = P * [((1 + r)^nt - 1) / r]</b><br>
|  'FV' = Future Value.<br>
|  'P' = Payment amount per period. (monthly payment)<br>
|  'r' = Interest rate per period (annual rate / number of periods per years)<br>
|  'n' = Number of periods per year.<br>
|  't' = Number of years.<br><br>

<h3>!Example:</h3>
If you pay 500 USD every month for 5 years, and the annual interest rate is 6%:<br>
|  'P' =  500<br>
|  'r' = 0.006 / 12 = 0.005<br>
|  'n' = 12<br>
|  't' = 5<br>
|  'FV' = 34,884 USD<br>
